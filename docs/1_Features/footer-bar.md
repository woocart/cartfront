## Footer Bar

<img src="" alt="Footer Bar">

Footer Bar makes it easy to add a widget area just above the footer. This is more useful for placing your call-to-action content such as **Subscribe Form**, **Social Links**, or just about anything prominent.

Footer Bar is active by default in the **Cartfront** theme and for displaying a widget, it needs to be added to the `Footer Bar` widget sidebar. Also, it offers few color customisation options which are listed below.

* **Background Image** - Apply a nice background image to the footer bar to enhance it's appearance.
* **Background Color** - Don't like to use an image? This option gives a background color to the footer bar. It won't show if the background image is applied.
* **Heading Color** - From `h1` to `h6`, this changes the color for all the headings in the footer bar.
* **Text Color** - Similar to the option above but for regular text only.
* **Link Color** - Allows to change the color for all the links in the footer bar.
