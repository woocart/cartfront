## Presets

<img src="" alt="Cartfront Presets">

One of the most powerful features of **Cartfront**, Presets allow you to completely revamp the look of your store with just a click of a button. It offers two options to configure the asthetics. They are as under:

* **Layouts** - With layouts, we can opt for the homepage structure exactly similar to one of the showcase stores. The **Header**, **Footer**, and **Homepage Components** gets configured exactly as shown in the selected showcase store.

* **Color Scheme** - This option imports the color scheme from the selected showcase store in the option and applies it your store giving it a perfectly similar look & feel.

Please note that both of the above options do override certain settings of the theme. So, you need to use this option carefully as you may lose your custom settings. But since this is made available via the Theme Customizer, you will always have the option to preview changes before applying them.
