## Hamburger Menu

<img src="" alt="Hamburger Menu">

Instead of the regular slide down menu, Hamburger Menu lets you have a nice slide from the left vertical navigation menu for smaller screen devices. It fits beautifully with any device having screen size smaller than **~768** pixels. Also, it adapts perfectly to the header color style for the navigation.

To activate, you simply need to tick the `checkbox` in the Theme Customizer and **Save** the changes. Settings for the Hamburger Menu are found under `Cartfront Settings` panel in the Customizer.
