## Slider

<img src="" alt="Slider">

Slider makes it easy to add a fully customizable Slider (posts, products, or custom) to the homepage. The panel for `Slider` is in the front of the Theme Customizer and is further divided into four sub-panels which are **General Settings**, **Posts Slider**, **Products Slider**, and **Custom Slider**. Like other components, this component can also be re-arranged on the homepage and it's visibility can be toggled via the `Homepage Control` section. Here is the list of all the available options.

### General Settings

This section allows to configure the overall settings for the slider section. Options available under this section are:

* **Select Slider** - Select between **Posts**, **Products**, or **Custom** Slider. The selected slider might need some configuration before it becomes visible. For ex - For Posts slider, you will need to select the posts to be shown in the slider and then only it starts to show in the customizer.
* **Section Title** - Title for the slider section to be shown on the homepage. Leave blank to hide it.
* **Items in a Row** - The number of items to be shown in a row (select between 1-4 items).
* **Number of Slider Items** - Restrict the total number of items to be shown in the slider. You can select between 1-15 items.

### Posts Slider

This section has two options available for the customisation of the Posts slider.

* **Posts** - With this multi-select option, you can choose the posts to be shown in the slider. You can select as many posts as you may like for the slider. Number of posts shown is still controlled by the `Number of Slider Items` in the `General Settings` section.
* **Posts Order** - Select the order in which you would like the posts to appear in the slider.

### Products Slider

This section has just one option available for the customisation of the Products slider. Products slider will only be visible if the `WooCommerce` plugin for WordPress is installed and active.

* **Products Type to Show** - Select from the different options of product types available to show in the slider. Available options are:
	* Featured Products
	* Best Selling Products
	* Recent Products
	* Top Rated Products
	* On Sale Products

### Custom Slider

Over here, we can add custom slides to the slider. Just make sure that the `Select Slider` option in the `General Settings` section has the right option selected.

For adding a custom slide - Each slider has 3 options - Image, Title and Link. These 3 fields are required for the slide to be visible in the customizer. You can add as many slides as you like by just clicking on the `Add Item` option at the bottom.

Number of custom slides shown is still controlled by the `Number of Slider Items` in the `General Settings` section.
