## Link Boxes

<img src="" alt="Link Boxes">

With Link Boxes, we can show prominent links on the homepage (to pages, posts, or just about anything) along with an image and title. `Link Boxes` have found their way under the `Cartfront Settings` in the Theme Customizer. There is no limit to the number of link boxes you can add but you can always configure the number to be shown in a row. If the number of boxes exceeds the number of items to be shown in a row, the remaining boxes get shifted to a new row. Here is the list of options available.

* **Section Title** - Title for the boxes section to be shown on the homepage. Leave blank to hide it.
* **Items in a Row** - The number of items to be shown in a row (select between 2-4 items).
* **Boxes** - This is where the main action takes place. Each box item has 3 options - Image, Title, and Link. These 3 fields are required for the box to be visible in the customizer. You can add as many boxes as you like by just clicking on the `Add Item` option at the bottom.
